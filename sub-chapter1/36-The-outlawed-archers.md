## The outlawed archers

Many years ago there dwelt in the forest of Inglewood, in the North
country, three yeomen, who had been outlawed for killing the king's
deer. They were all famous archers, and defying every attempt to arrest
them, they lived a free life in the green wood. But finally growing
tired of this dangerous life, they went to the king to sue for pardon.
It happened that the king's archers were exhibiting their skill by
shooting at marks, which none of them missed. But one of the outlawed
archers, named Cloudesly, made light of their skill, and told the king
that he could do better than any of his archers had done. "To prove the
truth of my claim," he said, "I will take my son, who is only seven
years old and is dear to me, and I will tie him to a stake, and lay an
apple on his head, and go six score paces from him, and with a broad
arrow I will cleave the apple in two."

"Now listen," said the king, "and do as you say; but if you touch his
head, or his dress, you shall be hanged all three."

"I will not go back on my word," said Cloudesly; and driving a stake
into the ground, he bound thereto his little son, and placed an apple on
his head. All being ready he bent his bow, the arrow flew from the
string, the apple was cleft in twain, and the child was unhurt. The king
thereupon pardoned the three outlaws and received them into his
service.
