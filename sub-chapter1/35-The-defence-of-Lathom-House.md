## The Defence of Lathom House

Lathom House is an old English castle. When the war broke out between
King Charles I and his people, the Earl of Derby, who was the master of
this castle, went away to fight for the king. He left the Countess at
home with her children, with a small band of armed men to guard her and
the castle. One day an army of the people's soldiers came to the castle,
and the leader of the army sent word to the Countess that she must give
up the castle at once.

But the Countess was a brave woman. She replied that she would rather
set fire to the castle, and die with her children in the flames, than
give it up to the king's enemies.

Then began a fight which lasted many weeks. The large army outside the
walls did their best to break a way in, but the small company inside
defended the castle bravely. At last the leader of the besiegers brought
a strong new gun, and it was soon seen that this would break down the
walls. Then one night the Countess sent out a party of brave men, who
seized the new gun and brought it into the castle, and so the worst
danger was over. Soon afterwards Prince Rupert, one of the king's
generals, came with an army to help the Countess, and Lathom House was
saved.

The prince drove away the soldiers of the people, and took from them
twenty-two banners, which he sent as a present to the Countess, to show
how much he admired her bravery.
