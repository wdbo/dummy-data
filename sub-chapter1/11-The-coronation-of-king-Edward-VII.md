## The Coronation of King Edward VII

Never had a country a more popular king than King Edward VII, nor a more
gracious queen than Queen Alexandra, and never was a happier day for the
English people than that on which King Edward was crowned. A few days
before the date fixed for the Coronation the king suddenly became ill,
and a great gloom fell over the country, for it was feared that he might
never be crowned. But though his illness was severe he soon began to get
better, and when he was out of danger the hearts of his subjects were
filled with joy and thankfulness. Guns were fired, church-bells pealed,
and glad shouts and cheers rang out from the happy crowds which lined
the streets of London, through which the king and queen, in the midst of
their gay procession, drove to Westminster Abbey.

Inside the gray old Abbey was one of the most brilliant gatherings the
world has ever seen. Princes and princesses from other lands were there,
in their robes of state; peers and peeresses, in velvet, and ermine, and
glittering diamonds; grave statesmen; and soldiers in their gay
uniforms.

It was a grand and solemn scene when, before them all, the aged
Archbishop of Canterbury drew near to the King, and with trembling hands
placed the crown upon his head.

"The Lord give you a fruitful country, and healthful seasons, victorious
fleets and armies, and a quiet Empire." These are the words that the old
man said when he had crowned the king, and each one of us will pray that
all these blessings may indeed rest upon King Edward VII, and the great
Empire over which he rules.
