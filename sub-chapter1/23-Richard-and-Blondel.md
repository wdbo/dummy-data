In a gloomy prison, in a foreign land, lay Richard I, King of England.
He had been with some other kings to a great war in the Holy Land, where
he had won battles, and taken cities, and gained much honour. Men called
him Richard Lion-heart, because he was as brave as a lion in fighting,
and his soldiers loved him and would follow him into any danger. One
strong city, called Acre, held out for nearly two years against the
armies of the other kings, but when Richard arrived it gave way almost
at once.

Because of his bravery, and his many victories, all men praised King
Richard, and this made some of the other kings hate him, for they were
jealous that he should have more honour than they. When he was on his
way back to England, one of these envious men seized him secretly, and
threw him into prison.

And now poor Richard could fight no more, nor could he see the blue sky,
and the green fields which he loved. One day, as he sat sad and lonely
in his prison, he heard a voice singing, beneath the window. He started.
"Surely," said he, "that is the voice of my old friend Blondel, and that
is the song we used to sing together." When the song was ended, the king
sang it again in a low voice. Then there was a joyful cry from the man
outside, and Richard knew that it was indeed his friend.

Blondel had journeyed many days seeking his lost master. Now he hastened
to England, and told the people where to find their king, and very soon
Richard was set free, and went back to his own land.
