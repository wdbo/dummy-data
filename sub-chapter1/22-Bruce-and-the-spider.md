## Bruce and the Spider

Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, sad and weary, lay upon the floor of a
lonely cave among the hills. His mind was full of anxious thoughts, for
he was hiding from the English soldiers, who sought to take him--alive
or dead--to their king. The brave Scots had lost many battles, and Bruce
began to fear that he would never make his dear country free.

"I will give up trying," said he.

Just then a spider, hanging from the roof of the cave, by a long thread,
swung before the king's eyes, and he left his gloomy thoughts to see
what the little creature would do.

The spider began to climb its thread slowly, pulling itself up little by
little; but it had gone only a short way, when it slipped and fell to
the end once more.

Again and again it started to climb, and again and again it slipped
back, until it had fallen six times.

"Surely the silly little creature will now give up trying to climb so
fine a thread," thought Bruce. But the spider did no such thing. It
started on its upward journey yet a seventh time, and this time it did
not fall. Up it went, inch by inch, higher and higher, until at last it
reached the roof, and was safely at home.

"Bravo!" cried the king. "The spider has taught me a lesson. I too will
try until I win."

Bruce kept his word. He led his brave men to battle, again and again,
until at last the English were driven back to their own land, and
Scotland was free.
