## A CAT'S EXTRAORDINARY LEAP


In the latter part of 1880, at a time when the Washington monument had
reached a height of 160 feet, an adventurous and patriotic cat ascended
the interior of the shaft by means of the ropes and tubing. When the
workmen arrived at the upper landing the next morning, and began to
prepare for the day's work, pussy took fright and, springing to the
outer edge, took a "header" of 160 feet to the hard earth below. In the
descent which was watched closely by two score of men, the cat spread
herself out like a flying squirrel and alighted on all fours. After
turning over on the ground a few times in a dazed manner, she prepared
to leave the grounds and had gotten almost beyond the shadow of the
monument, when a dog belonging to one of the workmen pounced upon her
and killed her, she, of course, not being in her best running trim,
after performing such an extraordinary feat. One of the men procured the
body of the dead feline, smoothed out her silky coat, and turned the
remains over to a representative of the Smithsonian Institution, who
mounted the skin and placed it under a glass case. The label on the case
tells this wonderful story in a few words: "This cat on September 23,
1880, jumped from the top of Washington's monument and lived."
