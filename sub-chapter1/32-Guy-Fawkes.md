## Guy Fawkes

In the time of James I, many of the English people were very hardly
treated because of their religion. At last they could bear the ill-usage
no longer, and they thought of a plan to get rid of the king and queen
and their eldest son.

Many barrels of gunpowder were secretly put into a cellar under the
Parliament House, where James was to meet his lords and commons on
November 5; and a man named Guy Fawkes was hired to set fire to it at
the right time, and so to blow up the hall above, and all in it.

All was ready, when one of the plotters remembered that a friend of his
would be at the meeting next day. As he did not wish him to be killed,
he sent him a letter, without signing his name, saying: "Do not go to
the House, for there shall be a sudden blow to many, and they shall not
see who hurts them".

The lord who received this letter took it to the King's Council, and
when King James saw it, he guessed what the "sudden blow" would be. Men
were sent to search the cellars, and there, on the very night before the
deed was to be done, Guy Fawkes was found waiting till the time should
come to set fire to the powder. He was cruelly tortured to make him tell
all he knew, but he was a brave man, and he died without betraying his
friends.

Since that time, every year, on the 5th of November, bonfires have been
lighted in many places in England, and "guys" burned, to remind people
how an English king was once saved from a great danger.
