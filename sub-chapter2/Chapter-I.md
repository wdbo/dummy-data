# CHAPTER I . DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEASUREMENT

### 1. ACCURATE MEASUREMENT

Accurate measurement is the foundation of
exact science, and at the very beginning of his study in astronomy the
student should learn something of the astronomer's kind of measurement.
He should practice measuring the stars with all possible care, and
should seek to attain the most accurate results of which his instruments
and apparatus are capable. The ordinary affairs of life furnish abundant
illustration of some of these measurements, such as finding the length
of a board in inches or the weight of a load of coal in pounds and
measurements of both length and weight are of importance in astronomy,
but of far greater astronomical importance than these are the
measurement of angles and the measurement of time. A kitchen clock or a
cheap watch is usually thought of as a machine to tell the "time of
day," but it may be used to time a horse or a bicycler upon a race
course, and then it becomes an instrument to measure the amount of time
required for covering the length of the course. Astronomers use a clock
in both of these ways--to tell the time at which something happens or is
done, and to measure the amount of time required for something; and in
using a clock for either purpose the student should learn to take the
time from it to the nearest second or better, if it has a seconds hand,
or to a small fraction of a minute, by estimating the position of the
minute hand between the minute marks on the dial. Estimate the fraction
in tenths of a minute, not in halves or quarters.

#### EXERCISE 1.
If several watches are available, let one person tap
sharply upon a desk with a pencil and let each of the others note the
time by the minute hand to the nearest tenth of a minute and record the
observations as follows:

|            |             |                   |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 2h. 44.5m. | First tap.  | 2h. 46.4m.  1.9m. |
| 2h. 44.9m. | Second tap. | 2h. 46.7m.  1.8m. |
| 2h. 46.6m  | Third tap.  | 2h. 48.6m.  2.0m. |

The letters h and m are used as abbreviations for hour and minute. The
first and second columns of the table are the record made by one
student, and second and third the record made by another. After all the
observations have been made and recorded they should be brought together
and compared by taking the differences between the times recorded for
each tap, as is shown in the last column. This difference shows how much
faster one watch is than the other, and the agreement or disagreement of
these differences shows the degree of accuracy of the observations. Keep
up this practice until tenths of a minute can be estimated with fair
precision.

### 2. ANGLES AND THEIR USE

An angle is the amount of opening or
difference of direction between two lines that cross each other. At
twelve o'clock the hour and minute hand of a watch point in the same
direction and the angle between them is zero. At one o'clock the minute
hand is again at XII, but the hour hand has moved to I, one twelfth part
of the circumference of the dial, and the angle between the hands is one
twelfth of a circumference. It is customary to imagine the circumference
of a dial to be cut up into 360 equal parts--i. e., each minute space of
an ordinary dial to be subdivided into six equal parts, each of which
is called a degree, and the measurement of an angle consists in finding
how many of these degrees are included in the opening between its sides.
At one o'clock the angle between the hands of a watch is thirty degrees,
which is usually written 30°, at three o'clock it is 90°, at six o'clock
180°, etc.

A watch may be used to measure angles. How? But a more convenient
instrument is the protractor, which is shown in [Fig. 1](Chapter-I.md#fig1), applied to the
angle `A B C` and showing that `A B C = 85°` as nearly as the protractor
scale can be read.

The student should have and use a protractor, such as is furnished with
this book, for the numerous exercises which are to follow.

#### EXERCISE 2.
![FIG. 1.--A protractor.][fig1] 
Draw neatly a triangle with sides about 100 millimeters
long, measure each of its angles and take their sum. No matter what may
be the shape of the triangle, this sum should be very nearly
180°--exactly 180° if the work were perfect--but perfection can seldom
be attained and one of the first lessons to be learned in any science
which deals with measurement is, that however careful we may be in our
work some minute error will cling to it and our results can be only
approximately correct. This, however, should not be taken as an excuse
for careless work, but rather as a stimulus to extra effort in order
that the unavoidable errors may be made as small as possible. In the
present case the measured angles may be improved a little by adding
(algebraically) to each of them one third of the amount by which their
sum falls short of 180°, as in the following example:

|           | Measured angles. | Correction. | Corrected angles. |
|           |   °              |    °        |     °             |
|-----------|:----------------:|:------------|-------------------|
| A         |  73.4            |  + 0.1      |    73.5           |
| B         |  49.3            |  + 0.1      |    49.4           |
| C         |  57.0            |  + 0.1      |    57.1           |
| Sum       | 179.7            |             |   180.0           |
| Defect    | + 0.3            |             |                   |

This process is in very common use among astronomers, and is called
"adjusting" the observations. ![FIG. 2.--Triangulation.][fig2]

### 3. TRIANGLES

The instruments used by astronomers for the measurement
of angles are usually provided with a telescope, which may be pointed at
different objects, and with a scale, like that of the protractor, to
measure the angle through which the telescope is turned in passing from
one object to another. In this way it is possible to measure the angle
between lines drawn from the instrument to two distant objects, such as
two church steeples or the sun and moon, and this is usually called the
angle between the objects. By measuring angles in this way it is
possible to determine the distance to an inaccessible point, as shown in
[Fig. 2](Chapter-I.md#fig2). A surveyor at `A` desires to know the distance to `C`, on the
opposite side of a river which he can not cross. He measures with a tape
line along his own side of the stream the distance `A B = 100 yards` and
then, with a suitable instrument, measures the angle at `A` between the
points `C` and `B`, and the angle at `B` between `C` and `A`, finding 
`B A C = 73.4°`, `A B C = 49.3°`. To determine the distance `A C` he draws
upon paper a line 100 millimeters long, and marks the ends `a` and `b`;
with a protractor he constructs at `a` the angle `b a c = 73.4°`, and at
`b` the angle `a b c = 49.3°`, and marks by `c` the point where the two
lines thus drawn meet. With the millimeter scale he now measures the
distance `a c = 90.2 millimeters`, which determines the distance `A C`
across the river to be `90.2 yards`, since the triangle on paper has been
made similar to the one across the river, and millimeters on the one
correspond to yards on the other. What is the proposition of geometry
upon which this depends? The measured distance `A B` in the surveyor's
problem is called a base line.

#### EXERCISE 3.
With a foot rule and a protractor measure a base line and
the angles necessary to determine the length of the schoolroom. After
the length has been thus found, measure it directly with the foot rule
and compare the measured length with the one found from the angles. If
any part of the work has been carelessly done, the student need not
expect the results to agree.

![FIG. 3.--Finding the moon's distance from the earth.][fig3]

In the same manner, by sighting at the moon from widely different parts
of the earth, as in [Fig. 3](Chapter-I.md#fig3), the moon's distance from us is found to be
about a quarter of a million miles. What is the base line in this case?

### 4. THE HORIZON--ALTITUDES

In their observations astronomers and
sailors make much use of the _plane of the horizon_, and practically any
flat and level surface, such as that of a smooth pond, may be regarded
as a part of this plane and used as such. A very common observation
relating to the plane of the horizon is called "taking the sun's
altitude," and consists in measuring the angle between the sun's rays
and the plane of the horizon upon which they fall. This angle between a
line and a plane appears slightly different from the angle between two
lines, but is really the same thing, since it means the angle between
the sun's rays and a line drawn in the plane of the horizon toward the
point directly under the sun. Compare this with the definition given in
the geographies, "The latitude of a point on the earth's surface is its
angular distance north or south of the equator," and note that the
latitude is the angle between the plane of the equator and a line drawn
from the earth's center to the given point on its surface.

A convenient method of obtaining a part of the plane of the horizon for
use in observation is as follows: Place a slate or a pane of glass upon
a table in the sunshine. Slightly moisten its whole surface and then
pour a little more water upon it near the center. If the water runs
toward one side, thrust the edge of a thin wooden wedge under this side
and block it up until the water shows no tendency to run one way rather
than another; it is then level and a part of the plane of the horizon.
Get several wedges ready before commencing the experiment. After they
have been properly placed, drive a pin or tack behind each one so that
it may not slip.

### 5. TAKING THE SUN'S ALTITUDE

#### EXERCISE 4.
Prepare a piece of board `20 centimeters`, or more, 
square, planed smooth on one face and one edge.
Drive a pin perpendicularly into the face of the board, near the middle
of the planed edge. Set the board on edge on the horizon plane and turn
it edgewise toward the sun so that a shadow of the pin is cast on the
plane. Stick another pin into the board, near its upper edge, so that
its shadow shall fall exactly upon the shadow of the first pin, and with
a watch or clock observe the time at which the two shadows coincide.
Without lifting the board from the plane, turn it around so that the
opposite edge is directed toward the sun and set a third pin just as the
second one was placed, and again take the time. Remove the pins and draw
fine pencil lines, connecting the holes, as shown in [Fig. 4](Chapter-I.md#fig4), and with
the protractor measure the angle thus marked. The student who has
studied elementary geometry should be able to demonstrate that at the
mean of the two recorded times the sun's altitude was equal to one half
of the angle measured in the figure.

![FIG. 4.--Taking the sun's altitude.][fig4]

When the board is turned edgewise toward the sun so that its shadow is
as thin as possible, rule a pencil line alongside it on the horizon
plane. The angle which this line makes with a line pointing due south is
called the sun's _azimuth_. When the sun is south, its azimuth is zero;
when west, it is `90°`; when east, `270°`, etc.

#### EXERCISE 5.
Let a number of different students take the sun's altitude
during both the morning and afternoon session and note the time of each
observation, to the nearest minute. Verify the setting of the plane of
the horizon from time to time, to make sure that no change has occurred
in it.

### 6. GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATIONS

Make a graph (drawing) of all the
observations, similar to [Fig. 5](Chapter-I.md#fig5), and find by bisecting a set of chords
`g` to `g`, `e` to `e`, `d` to `d`, drawn parallel to `B B`, the time at
which the sun's altitude was greatest. In [Fig. 5](Chapter-I.md#fig5) we see from the
intersection of `M M` with `B B` that this time was `11h. 50m`.

The method of graphs which is here introduced is of great importance in
physical science, and the student should carefully observe in [Fig. 5](Chapter-I.md#fig5)
that the line `B B` is a scale of times, which may be made long or
short, provided only the intervals between consecutive hours 9 to 10, 10
to 11, 11 to 12, etc., are equal. The distance of each little circle
from `B B` is taken proportional to the sun's altitude, and may be upon
any desired scale--e. g., a millimeter to a degree--provided the same
scale is used for all observations. Each circle is placed accurately
over that part of the base line which corresponds to the time at which
the altitude was taken. Square ruled paper is very convenient, although
not necessary, for such diagrams. It is especially to be noted that from
the few observations which are represented in the figure a smooth curve
has been drawn through the circles which represent the sun's altitude,
and this curve shows the altitude of the sun at every moment between 9
A. M. and 3 P. M. In [Fig. 5](Chapter-I.md#fig5) the sun's altitude at noon was `57°`. What was
it at half past two?

![FIG. 5.--A graph of the sun's altitude.][fig5]

### 7. DIAMETER OF A DISTANT OBJECT

By sighting over a protractor, measure
the angle between imaginary lines drawn from it to the opposite sides of
a window. Carry the protractor farther away from the window and repeat
the experiment, to see how much the angle changes. The angle thus
measured is called "the angle subtended" by the window at the place
where the measurement was made. If this place was squarely in front of
the window we may draw upon paper an angle equal to the measured one and
lay off from the vertex along its sides a distance proportional to the
distance of the window--e. g., a millimeter for each centimeter of real
distance. If a cross line be now drawn connecting the points thus found,
its length will be proportional to the width of the window, and the
width may be read off to scale, a centimeter for every millimeter in the
length of the cross line.

The astronomer who measures with an appropriate instrument the angle
subtended by the moon may in an entirely similar manner find the moon's
diameter and has, in fact, found it to be `2,163 miles`. Can the same
method be used to find the diameter of the sun? A planet? The earth?
