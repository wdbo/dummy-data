# CHAPTER II . THE STARS AND THEIR DIURNAL MOTION

### 8. THE STARS

From the very beginning of his study in astronomy, and as
frequently as possible, the student should practice watching the stars
by night, to become acquainted with the constellations and their
movements. As an introduction to this study he may face toward the
north, and compare the stars which he sees in that part of the sky with
the map of the northern heavens, given on [Plate I](Plate-I.jpg) [...].
Turn the map around, upside down if necessary, until the stars upon it
match the brighter ones in the sky. Note how the stars are grouped in
such conspicuous constellations as the Big Dipper (Ursa Major), the
Little Dipper (Ursa Minor), and Cassiopeia. These three constellations
should be learned so that they can be recognized at any time.

The names of the stars
:   Facing the star map is a key which contains
    the names of the more important constellations and the names of the
    brighter stars in their constellations. These names are for the most
    part a Greek letter prefixed to the genitive case of the Latin name of
    the constellation. (See the Greek alphabet printed at the end of the
    book.)

### 9. MAGNITUDES OF THE STARS

Nearly nineteen centuries ago St. Paul
noted that "one star differeth from another star in glory," and no more
apt words can be found to mark the difference of brightness which the
stars present. Even prior to St. Paul's day the ancient Greek
astronomers had divided the stars in respect of brightness into six
groups, which the modern astronomers still use, calling each group a
_magnitude_. Thus a few of the brightest stars are said to be of the
first magnitude, the great mass of faint ones which are just visible to
the unaided eye are said to be of the sixth magnitude, and intermediate
degrees of brilliancy are represented by the intermediate magnitudes,
second, third, fourth, and fifth. The student must not be misled by the
word magnitude. It has no reference to the size of the stars, but only
to their brightness, and on the star maps of this book the larger and
smaller circles by which the stars are represented indicate only the
brightness of the stars according to the system of magnitudes. Following
the indications of these maps, the student should, in learning the
principal stars and constellations, learn also to recognize how bright
is a star of the second, fourth, or other magnitude.

### 10. OBSERVING THE STARS

Find on the map and in the sky the stars
α Ursæ Minoris, α Ursæ Majoris, β Ursæ Majoris. What geometrical
figure will fit on to these stars? In addition to its regular name,
α Ursæ Minoris is frequently called by the special name Polaris, or
the pole star. Why are the other two stars called "the Pointers"? What
letter of the alphabet do the five bright stars in Cassiopeia suggest?

#### EXERCISE 6.
Stand in such a position that Polaris is just hidden behind
the corner of a building or some other vertical line, and mark upon the
key map as accurately as possible the position of this line with respect
to the other stars, showing which stars are to the right and which are
to the left of it. Record the time (date, hour, and minute) at which
this observation was made. An hour or two later repeat the observation
at the same place, draw the line and note the time, and you will find
that the line last drawn upon the map does not agree with the first one.
The stars have changed their positions, and with respect to the vertical
line the Pointers are now in a different direction from Polaris.
Measure with a protractor the angle between the two lines drawn in the
map, and use this angle and the recorded times of the observation to
find how many degrees per hour this direction is changing. It should be
about 15° per hour. If the observation were repeated 12 hours after the
first recorded time, what would be the position of the vertical line
among the stars? What would it be 24 hours later? A week later? Repeat
the observation on the next clear night, and allowing for the number of
whole revolutions made by the stars between the two dates, again
determine from the time interval a more accurate value of the rate at
which the stars move.

The motion of the stars which the student has here detected is called
their "diurnal" motion. What is the significance of the word diurnal?

In the preceding paragraph there is introduced a method of great
importance in astronomical practice--i. e., determining something--in
this case the rate per hour, from observations separated by a long
interval of time, in order to get a more accurate value than could be
found from a short interval. Why is it more accurate? To determine the
rate at which the planet Mars rotates about its axis, astronomers use
observations separated by an interval of more than 200 years, during
which the planet made more than 75,000 revolutions upon its axis. If we
were to write out in algebraic form an equation for determining the
length of one revolution of Mars about its axis, the large number,
75,000, would appear in the equation as a divisor, and in the final
result would greatly reduce whatever errors existed in the observations
employed.

Repeat [Exercise 6](exercise-6) night after night, and note whether the stars come
back to the same position at the same hour and minute every night.

![FIG. 6. The plumb-line apparatus.][fig6]
![FIG. 7. The plumb-line apparatus.][fig7]

### 11. THE PLUMB-LINE APPARATUS

This experiment, and many others, may be
conveniently and accurately made with no other apparatus than a plumb
line, and a device for sighting past it. In Figs. [6](Chapter-II.md#fig6) and [7](Chapter-II.md#fig7) there is
shown a simple form of such apparatus, consisting essentially of a board
which rests in a horizontal position upon the points of three screws
that pass through it. This board carries a small box, to one side of
which is nailed in vertical position another board 5 or 6 feet long to
carry the plumb line. This consists of a wire or fish line with any
heavy weight--e. g., a brick or flatiron--tied to its lower end and
immersed in a vessel of water placed inside the box, so as to check any
swinging motion of the weight. In the cover of the box is a small hole
through which the wire passes, and by turning the screws in the
baseboard the apparatus may be readily leveled, so that the wire shall
swing freely in the center of the hole without touching the cover of the
box. Guy wires, shown in the figure, are applied so as to stiffen the
whole apparatus. A board with a screw eye at each end may be pivoted to
the upright, as in [Fig. 6](Chapter-II.md#fig6), for measuring altitudes; or to the box, as in
[Fig. 7](Chapter-II.md#fig7), for observing the time at which a star in its diurnal motion
passes through the plane determined by the plumb line and the center of
the screw eye through which the observer looks.

The whole apparatus may be constructed by any person of ordinary
mechanical skill at a very small cost, and it or something equivalent
should be provided for every class beginning observational astronomy. To
use the apparatus for the experiment of [§ 10](#10-observing-the-stars), it should be leveled, and
the board with the screw eyes, attached as in [Fig. 7](Chapter-II.md#fig7), should be turned
until the observer, looking through the screw eye, sees Polaris exactly
behind the wire. Use a bicycle lamp to illumine the wire by night. The
apparatus is now adjusted, and the observer has only to wait for the
stars which he desires to observe, and to note by his watch the time at
which they pass behind the wire. It will be seen that the wire takes the
place of the vertical edge of the building, and that the board with the
screw eyes is introduced solely to keep the observer in the right place
relative to the wire.

### 12. A SIDEREAL CLOCK

Clocks are sometimes so made and regulated that
they show always the same hour and minute when the stars come back to
the same place, and such a timepiece is called a sidereal clock--i. e.,
a star-time clock. Would such a clock gain or lose in comparison with an
ordinary watch? Could an ordinary watch be turned into a sidereal watch
by moving the regulator?

[![FIG. 8.--Photographing the circumpolar stars.--BARNARD.][fig8]](assets/i028-full.jpg)

### 13. PHOTOGRAPHING THE STARS

#### EXERCISE 7.
For any student who uses a
camera. Upon some clear and moonless night point the camera, properly
focused, at Polaris, and expose a plate for three or four hours. Upon
developing the plate you should find a series of circular trails such as
are shown in [Fig. 8](Chapter-II.md#fig8), only longer. Each one of these is produced by a
star moving slowly over the plate, in consequence of its changing
position in the sky. The center indicated by these curved trails is
called the pole of the heavens. It is that part of the sky toward which
is pointed the axis about which the earth rotates, and the motion of the
stars around the center is only an apparent motion due to the rotation
of the earth which daily carries the observer and his camera around this
axis while the stars stand still, just as trees and fences and telegraph
poles stand still, although to the passenger upon a railway train they
appear to be in rapid motion. So far as simple observations are
concerned, there is no method by which the pupil can tell for himself
that the motion of the stars is an apparent rather than a real one, and,
following the custom of astronomers, we shall habitually speak as if it
were a real movement of the stars. How long was the plate exposed in
photographing [Fig. 8](Chapter-II.md#fig8)?

### 14. FINDING THE STARS

On [Plate I](Plate-I.jpg) [...], the pole of the
heavens is at the center of the map, near Polaris, and the heavy trail
near the center of [Fig. 8](Chapter-II.md#fig8) is made by Polaris. See if you can identify
from the map any of the stars whose trails show in the photograph. The
brighter the star the bolder and heavier its trail.

Find from the map and locate in the sky the two bright stars Capella and
Vega, which are on opposite sides of Polaris and nearly equidistant from
it. Do these stars share in the motion around the pole? Are they visible
on every clear night, and all night?

Observe other bright stars farther from Polaris than are Vega and
Capella and note their movement. Do they move like the sun and moon? Do
they rise and set?

In what part of the sky do the stars move most rapidly, near the pole or
far from it?

How long does it take the fastest moving stars to make the circuit of
the sky and come back to the same place? How long does it take the slow
stars?

### 15. RISING AND SETTING OF THE STARS

A study of the sky along the lines
indicated in these questions will show that there is a considerable part
of it surrounding the pole whose stars are visible on every clear night.
The same star is sometimes high in the sky, sometimes low, sometimes to
the east of the pole and at other times west of it, but is always above
the horizon. Such stars are said to be circumpolar. A little farther
from the pole each star, when at the lowest point of its circular path,
dips for a time below the horizon and is lost to view, and the farther
it is away from the pole the longer does it remain invisible, until, in
the case of stars 90° away from the pole, we find them hidden below the
horizon for twelve hours out of every twenty-four (see [Fig. 9](Chapter-II.md#fig9)). The sun
is such a star, and in its rising and setting acts precisely as does
every other star at a similar distance from the pole--only, as we shall
find later, each star keeps always at (nearly) the same distance from
the pole, while the sun in the course of a year changes its distance
from the pole very greatly, and thus changes the amount of time it
spends above and below the horizon, producing in this way the long days
of summer and the short ones of winter.

[![FIG. 9.--Diurnal motion of the northern constellations.][fig9]](assets/i030-full.jpg)

How much time do stars which are more than 90° from the pole spend above
the horizon?

We say in common speech that the sun rises in the east, but this is
strictly true only at the time when it is 90° distant from the
pole--i. e., in March and September. At other seasons it rises north or
south of east according as its distance from the pole is less or greater
than 90°, and the same is true for the stars.

### 16. THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE SKY

Find from a map the latitude and
longitude of your schoolhouse. Find on the map the place whose latitude
is 39° and longitude 77° west of the meridian of Greenwich. Is there any
other place in the world which has the same latitude and longitude as
your schoolhouse?

The places of the stars in the sky are located in exactly the manner
which is illustrated by these geographical questions, only different
names are used. Instead of latitude the astronomer says _declination_,
in place of longitude he says _right ascension_, in place of meridian he
says _hour circle_, but he means by these new names the same ideas that
the geographer expresses by the old ones.

Imagine the earth swollen up until it fills the whole sky; the earth's
equator would meet the sky along a line (a great circle) everywhere 90°
distant from the pole, and this line is called the _celestial equator_.
Trace its position along the middle of the map [*[of Plate II](Plate-II.jpg)*] and
notice near what stars it runs. Every meridian of the swollen earth
would touch the sky along an hour circle--i. e., a great circle passing
through the pole and therefore perpendicular to the equator. Note that
in the map one of these hour circles is marked 0. It plays the same part
in measuring right ascensions as does the meridian of Greenwich in
measuring longitudes; it is the beginning, from which they are reckoned.
Note also, at the extreme left end of the map, the four bright stars in
the form of a square, one side of which is parallel and close to the
hour circle, which is marked 0. This is familiarly called the Great
Square in Pegasus, and may be found high up in the southern sky whenever
the Big Dipper lies below the pole. Why can it not be seen when Ursa
Major is above the pole?

Astronomers use the right ascensions of the stars not only to tell in
what part of the sky the star is placed, but also in time reckonings, to
regulate their sidereal clocks, and with regard to this use they find
it convenient to express right ascension not in degrees but in hours,
24 of which fill up the circuit of the sky and each of which is equal
to 15° of arc, `24 × 15 = 360`. The right ascension of Capella is
`5h. 9m. = 77.2°`, but the student should accustom himself to using it
in hours and minutes as given and not to change it into degrees. He
should also note that some stars lie on the side of the celestial
equator toward Polaris, and others are on the opposite side, so that the
astronomer has to distinguish between north declinations and south
declinations, just as the geographer distinguishes between north
latitudes and south latitudes. This is done by the use of the + and -
signs, a + denoting that the star lies north of the celestial equator,
i. e., toward Polaris.

[![FIG. 10.--From a photograph of the Pleiades.][fig10]](assets/i032-full.jpg)

Find on [Plate II](Plate-II.jpg) [...], the Pleiades (Plēadēs),
`R. A. = 3h. 42m.`, `Dec. = +23.8°`. Why do they not show on [Plate I](Plate-I.jpg)
[...]? In what direction are they from Polaris? This is one
of the finest star clusters in the sky, but it needs a telescope to
bring out its richness. See how many stars you can count in it with the
naked eye, and afterward examine it with an opera glass. Compare what
you see with [Fig. 10](Chapter-II.md#fig10). Find Antares, `R. A. = 16h. 23m.`, `Dec. = -26.2°`. How
far is it, in degrees, from the pole? Is it visible in your sky? If so,
what is its color?

Find the R. A. and Dec. of α Ursæ Majoris; of β Ursæ Majoris; of
Polaris. Find the Northern Crown, _Corona Borealis_, `R. A. = 15h. 30m.`,
`Dec. = +27.0°`; the Beehive, _Præsepe_, `R. A. = 8h. 33m.`, `Dec. = +20.4°`.

These should be looked up, not only on the map, but also in the sky.

### 17. REFERENCE LINES AND CIRCLES

As the stars move across the sky in
their diurnal motion, they carry the framework of hour circles and
equator with them, so that the right ascension and declination of each
star remain unchanged by this motion, just as longitudes and latitudes
remain unchanged by the earth's rotation. They are the same when a star
is rising and when it is setting; when it is above the pole and when it
is below it. During each day the hour circle of every star in the
heavens passes overhead, and at the moment when any particular hour
circle is exactly overhead all the stars which lie upon it are said to
be "on the meridian"--i. e., at that particular moment they stand
directly over the observer's geographical meridian and upon the
corresponding celestial meridian.

![FIG. 11.--Reference lines and circles.][fig11]
An eye placed at the center of the earth and capable of looking through
its solid substance would see your geographical meridian against the
background of the sky exactly covering your celestial meridian and
passing from one pole through your zenith to the other pole. In [Fig. 11](Chapter-II.md#fig11)
the inner circle represents the terrestrial meridian of a certain
place, `O`, as seen from the center of the earth, `C`, and the outer
circle represents the celestial meridian of `O` as seen from `C`, only
we must imagine, what can not be shown on the figure, that the outer
circle is so large that the inner one shrinks to a mere point in
comparison with it. If `C P` represents the direction in which the
earth's axis passes through the center, then `C E` at right angles to it
must be the direction of the equator which we suppose to be turned
edgewise toward us; and if `C O` is the direction of some particular
point on the earth's surface, then `Z` directly overhead is called the
`zenith` of that point, upon the celestial sphere. The line `C H`
represents a direction parallel to the horizon plane at `O`, and `H C P`
is the angle which the axis of the earth makes with this horizon plane.
The arc `O E` measures the latitude of `O`, and the arc `Z E` measures
the declination of `Z`, and since by elementary geometry each of these
arcs contains the same number of degrees as the angle `E C Z`, we have
the

##### Theorem
The latitude of any place is equal to the declination of its zenith.

##### Corollary
Any star whose declination is equal to your latitude will
once in each day pass through your zenith.

### 18. LATITUDE

From the construction of the figure

\[∠ _E C Z_ + ∠ _Z C P_ = 90°\]
\[∠ _H C P_ + ∠ _Z C P_ = 90°\]

from which we find by subtraction and transposition

\[∠ _E C Z_ = ∠ _H C P_\]

and this gives the further

##### Theorem
The latitude of any place is equal to the elevation of the
pole above its horizon plane.

An observer who travels north or south over the earth changes his
latitude, and therefore changes the angle between his horizon plane and
the axis of the earth. What effect will this have upon the position of
stars in his sky? If you were to go to the earth's equator, in what part
of the sky would you look for Polaris? Can Polaris be seen from
Australia? From South America? If you were to go from Minnesota to
Texas, in what respect would the appearance of stars in the northern sky
be changed? How would the appearance of stars in the southern sky be
changed?

#### EXERCISE 8.
![FIG. 12.--Diurnal path of Polaris.][fig12]
Determine your latitude by taking the altitude of Polaris
when it is at some one of the four points of its diurnal path, shown in
[Fig. 12](Chapter-II.md#fig12). When it is at `1` it is said to be at upper culmination, and
the star ζ Ursæ Majoris in the handle of the Big Dipper will be
directly below it. When at `2` it is at western elongation, and the star
Castor is near the meridian. When it is at `3` it is at lower
culmination, and the star Spica is on the meridian. When it is at `4` it
is at eastern elongation, and Altair is near the meridian. All of these
stars are conspicuous ones, which the student should find upon the map
and learn to recognize in the sky. The altitude observed at either `2`
or `4` may be considered equal to the latitude of the place, but the
altitude observed when Polaris is at the positions marked `1` and `3`
must be corrected for the star's distance from the pole, which may be
assumed equal to `1.3°`.

The plumb-line apparatus described [*in chapter II*] is shown in [Fig. 6](Chapter-II.md#fig6)
slightly modified, so as to adapt it to measuring the altitudes of
stars. Note that the board with the screw eye at one end has been
transferred from the box to the vertical standard, and has a screw eye
at each end. When the apparatus has been properly leveled, so that the
plumb line hangs at the middle of the hole in the box cover, the board
is to be pointed at the star by sighting through the centers of the two
screw eyes, and a pencil line is to be ruled along its edge upon the
face of the vertical standard. After this has been done turn the
apparatus halfway around so that what was the north side now points
south, level it again and revolve the board about the screw which holds
it to the vertical standard, until the screw eyes again point to the
star. Rule another line along the same edge of the board as before and
with a protractor measure the angle between these lines. Use a bicycle
lamp if you need artificial light for your work. The student who has
studied plane geometry should be able to prove that one half of the
angle between these lines is equal to the altitude of the star.

After you have determined your latitude from Polaris, compare the result
with your position as shown upon the best map available. With a little
practice and considerable care the latitude may be thus determined
within one tenth of a degree, which is equivalent to about 7 miles. If
you go 10 miles north or south from your first station you should find
the pole higher up or lower down in the sky by an amount which can be
measured with your apparatus.

### 19. THE MERIDIAN LINE

To establish a true north and south line upon
the ground, use the apparatus as described [*in chapter II*], and when Polaris
is at upper or lower culmination drive into the ground two stakes in
line with the star and the plumb line. Such a meridian line is of great
convenience in observing the stars and should be laid out and
permanently marked in some convenient open space from which, if
possible, all parts of the sky are visible. June and November are
convenient months for this exercise, since Polaris then comes to
culmination early in the evening.

### 20. TIME

What is _the time_ at which school begins in the morning?
What do you mean by "_the time_"?

The sidereal time at any moment is the right ascension of the hour
circle which at that moment coincides with the meridian. When the hour
circle passing through Sirius coincides with the meridian, the sidereal
time is 6h. 40m., since that is the right ascension of Sirius, and in
astronomical language Sirius is "_on the meridian_" at 6h. 40m. sidereal
time. As may be seen from the map, this 6h. 40m. is the right ascension
of Sirius, and if a clock be set to indicate 6h. 40m. when Sirius
crosses the meridian, it will show sidereal time. If the clock is
properly regulated, every other star in the heavens will come to the
meridian at the moment when the time shown by the clock is equal to the
right ascension of the star. A clock properly regulated for this purpose
will gain about four minutes per day in comparison with ordinary clocks,
and when so regulated it is called a sidereal clock. The student should
be provided with such a clock for his future work, but one such clock
will serve for several persons, and a nutmeg clock or a watch of the
cheapest kind is quite sufficient.

#### EXERCISE 9.
Set such a clock to sidereal time by means of the transit
of a star over your meridian. For this experiment it is presupposed that
a meridian line has been marked out on the ground as in [§ 19](#19-the-meridian-line), and the
simplest mode of performing the experiment required is for the observer,
having chosen a suitable star in the southern part of the sky, to place
his eye accurately over the northern end of the meridian line and to
estimate as nearly as possible the beginning and end of the period
during which the star appears to stand exactly above the southern end of
the line. The middle of this period may be taken as the time at which
the star crossed the meridian and at this moment the sidereal time is
equal to the right ascension of the star. The difference between this
right ascension and the observed middle instant is the error of the
clock or the amount by which its hands must be set back or forward in
order to indicate true sidereal time.

A more accurate mode of performing the experiment consists in using the
plumb-line apparatus carefully adjusted, as in [Fig. 7](Chapter-II.md#fig7), so that the line
joining the wire to the center of the screw eye shall be parallel to the
meridian line. Observe the time by the clock at which the star
disappears behind the wire as seen through the center of the screw eye.
If the star is too high up in the sky for convenient observation, place
a mirror, face up, just north of the screw eye and observe star, wire
and screw eye by reflection in it.

The numerical right ascension of the observed star is needed for this
experiment, and it may be measured from the star map, but it will
usually be best to observe one of the stars of the table at the end of
the book, and to obtain its right ascension as follows: The table gives
the right ascension and declination of each star as they were at the
beginning of the year 1900, but on account of the precession (see
[Chapter V](Chapter-V.md)), these numbers all change slowly with the lapse of time, and
on the average the right ascension of each star of the table must be
increased by one twentieth of a minute for each year after 1900--i. e.,
in 1910 the right ascension of the first star of the table will be
`0h. 38.6m. + (10/20)m. = 0h. 39.1m`. The declinations also change
slightly, but as they are only intended to help in finding the star on
the star maps, their change may be ignored.

Having set the clock approximately to sidereal time, observe one or two
more stars in the same way as above. The difference between the observed
time and the right ascension, if any is found, is the "correction" of
the clock. This correction ought not to exceed a minute if due care has
been taken in the several operations prescribed. The relation of the
clock to the right ascension of the stars is expressed in the following
equation, with which the student should become thoroughly familiar:

\[A = T ± U\]

`T` stands for the time by the clock at which the star crossed the
meridian. `A` is the right ascension of the star, and `U` is the
correction of the clock. Use the `+` sign in the equation whenever the
clock is too slow, and the `-` sign when it is too fast. `U` may be found
from this equation when `A` and `T` are given, or `A` may be found when
`T` and `U` are given. It is in this way that astronomers measure the
right ascensions of the stars and planets.

Determine `U` from each star you have observed, and note how the several
results agree one with another.

### 21. DEFINITIONS

To define a thing or an idea is to give a description
sufficient to identify it and distinguish it from every other possible
thing or idea. If a definition does not come up to this standard it is
insufficient. Anything beyond this requirement is certainly useless and
probably mischievous.

Let the student define the following geographical terms, and let him
also criticise the definitions offered by his fellow-students: Equator,
poles, meridian, latitude, longitude, north, south, east, west.

Compare the following astronomical definitions with your geographical
definitions, and criticise them in the same way. If you are not able to
improve upon them, commit them to memory:

The Poles
:   of the heavens are those points in the sky toward which the
    earth's axis points. How many are there? The one near Polaris is called
    the north pole.

The Celestial Equator
:   is a great circle of the sky distant 90° from
    the poles.

The Zenith
:   is that point of the sky, overhead, toward which a plumb
    line points. Why is the word overhead placed in the definition? Is there
    more than one zenith?

The Horizon
:   is a great circle of the sky 90° distant from the zenith.

An Hour Circle
:   is any great circle of the sky which passes through the
    poles. Every star has its own hour circle.

The Meridian
:   is that hour circle which passes through the zenith.

A Vertical Circle
:   is any great circle that passes through the zenith.
    Is the meridian a vertical circle?

The Declination
:   of a star is its angular distance north or south of
    the celestial equator.

The Right Ascension
:   of a star is the angle included between its hour
    circle and the hour circle of a certain point on the equator which is
    called the _Vernal Equinox_. From spherical geometry we learn that this
    angle is to be measured either at the pole where the two hour circles
    intersect, as is done in the star map [*[of Plate I](Plate-I.jpg)*], or along the
    equator, as is done in the map opposite [*[of Plate II](Plate-II.jpg)*]. Right ascension is
    always measured from the vernal equinox in the direction opposite to
    that in which the stars appear to travel in their diurnal motion--i. e.,
    from west toward east.

The Altitude
:   of a star is its angular distance above the horizon.

The Azimuth
:   of a star is the angle between the meridian and the
    vertical circle passing through the star. A star due south has an
    azimuth of 0°. Due west, 90°. Due north, 180°. Due east, 270°.

:   What is the azimuth of Polaris in degrees?

:   What is the azimuth of the sun at sunrise? At sunset? At noon? Are these
    azimuths the same on different days?

The Hour Angle
:   of a star is the angle between its hour circle and the
    meridian. It is measured from the meridian in the direction in which the
    stars appear to travel in their diurnal motion--i. e., from east toward
    west.

:   What is the hour angle of the sun at noon? What is the hour angle of
    Polaris when it is at the lowest point in its daily motion?

### 22. EXERCISES

The student must not be satisfied with merely learning
these definitions. He must learn to see these points and lines in his
mind as if they were visibly painted upon the sky. To this end it will
help him to note that the poles, the zenith, the meridian, the horizon,
and the equator seem to stand still in the sky, always in the same place
with respect to the observer, while the hour circles and the vernal
equinox move with the stars and keep the same place among them. Does the
apparent motion of a star change its declination or right ascension?
What is the hour angle of the sun when it has the greatest altitude?
Will your answer to the preceding question be true for a star? What is
the altitude of the sun after sunset? In what direction is the north
pole from the zenith? From the vernal equinox? Where are the points in
which the meridian and equator respectively intersect the horizon?
