## THE GREEK ALPHABET

The Greek letters are so much used by astronomers in connection with the
names of the stars, and for other purposes, that the Greek alphabet is
printed below--not necessarily to be learned, but for convenient
reference:

    Greek.          Name.  English.

## POPULAR LITERATURE OF ASTRONOMY

The following brief bibliography, while making no pretense at
completeness, may serve as a useful guide to supplementary reading:

### General Treatises

*   YOUNG. _General Astronomy._ An admirable general survey of the
    entire field.

*   NEWCOMB. _Popular Astronomy._ The second edition of a German
    translation of this work by Engelmann and Vogel is especially
    valuable.

*   BALL. _Story of the Heavens._ Somewhat easier reading than
    either of the preceding.

*   CHAMBERS. _Descriptive Astronomy._ An elaborate but elementary
    work in three volumes.

*   LANGLEY. _The New Astronomy._ Treats mainly of the physical
    condition of the celestial bodies.

*   PROCTOR and RANYARD. _Old and New Astronomy._

### Special Treatises

*   PROCTOR. _The Moon._ A general treatment of the subject.

*   NASMYTH and CARPENTER. _The Moon._ An admirably illustrated but
    expensive work dealing mainly with the topography and physical
    conditions of the moon. There is a cheaper and very good edition
    in German.

*   YOUNG. _The Sun._ International Scientific Series. The most
    recent and authoritative treatise on this subject.

*   PROCTOR. _Other Worlds than Ours._ An account of planets,
    comets, etc.

*   NEWTON. _Meteor._ Encyclopædia Britannica.

*   AIRY. _Gravitation._ A non-mathematical exposition of the laws
    of planetary motion.

*   STOKES. _On Light as a Means of Investigation._ Burnett
    Lectures. II. The basis of spectrum analysis.

*   SCHELLEN. _Spectrum Analysis._

*   THOMSON (Sir W., Lord KELVIN), _Popular Lectures, etc._ Lectures
    on the Tides, The Sun's Heat, etc.

*   BALL. _Time and Tide._ An exposition of the researches of G. H.
    Darwin upon tidal friction.

*   GORE. _The Visible Universe._ Deals with a class of problems
    inadequately treated in most popular astronomies.

*   DARWIN. _The Tides._ An admirable elementary exposition.

*   CLERKE. _The System of the Stars._ Stellar astronomy.

*   NEWCOMB. Chapters on the Stars, in _Popular Science Monthly_ for
    1900.

*   CLERKE. _History of Astronomy during the Nineteenth Century._ An
    admirable work.

*   WOLF. _Geschichte der Astronomie._ München, 1877. An excellent
    German work.
